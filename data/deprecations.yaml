  release: Canberra
  flag: true
  comment: |-
    Enable support for Models that have no primary key.
    Breaking change for old versions as previously the Create API returned a location
    header. Also the model advertised unsupported methods.
  summary: >-
    for models that do not have a primary key:


    * The `delete`, `findAndModify`, `findByID`, `upsert`, and `update` APIs and endpoints will not
    be generated.

    * The Model flow-node will not have `delete`, `findAndModify`, `findByID`, `upsert`, or `update`
    methods.

    * The Create API will no longer return a `location` header.

    Breaking change for old versions as previously queries $lt, $gt, $lte, $gte, $in, $nin,
    $eq would not have translated aliased fields.
  summary: >-
    Queries on Composite Models will support comparison operators (`$eq`, `$ne`, `$in`, `$nin`,
    `$lt`, `$lte`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$like`) on aliased fields.

    Enable support for model names being percent-encoded as per RFC-3986 in auto-generated API.
    Breaking change for old versions as previously names like "foo/bar" will now be encoded as
    "foo%2Fbar".
  summary: >-
    model names are URI encoded as per [RFC-3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt), and the

D013:
  name: enableNullModelFields
  release: Quebec
  flag: true
  comment: |-
    Enable support for null fields coming from Models.

  comment: |-
    Enable support for model names being encoded whilst preserving the connector's slash.
    This flag only applies when enableModelNameEncodingInSwagger is enabled.
    Breaking change for old versions as previously model names that start with a connector name,
    e.g. "oracle/foÃ³" will now be encoded as "oracle/fo%C3%B3".
  summary: >-
    model names which are prefixed with their connector name (in other words, oracle/user) will no
    longer have the slash encoded as %2F in auto-generated API paths.
