The Microsoft SQL Server data connector is a plugin for {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} that can connect to your MSSQL instance and interrogate your schema that will automatically provision Models into your project, and optionally, automatically generate a rich CRUD API to the underlying tables. The Models can be used programmatically, or can be used within the flow editor to interact with your database.

## Minimum requirements

The following are the supported versions and features and the approximate memory and disk space requirements.

### Supported versions

* SQL Server 2008 or later

### Memory

* Approximately 8 MB

### Disk space

* Approximately 15 MB

### Supported features

* Automatic generation of Models from SQL tables
* Automatic generation of API for Models
* Full CRUD operations on tables via Models

## Installation

```bash
npm install --no-optional @axway/api-builder-plugin-dc-mssql
```

A configuration file is generated for you and placed into the `./conf` directory of your {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} project. By default, we use a host of `localhost`, and expect user and password to come from the OS host environment.

## Configuration

Once the plugin is installed, the configuration file is located in `<project>/conf/mssql.default.js`.

| Option name | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------- |
| connector   | string | Must be: `@axway/api-builder-plugin-dc-mssql` |
| user | string | The user with which to connect to the database. |
| password | string | The user's password with which to connect to the database. |
| host | string | The database host. |
| port | number | The database post. |
| database | string | The database instance name. |
| connectionTimeout | number | Connection timeout in MS |
| requestTimeout | number | Request timeout in MS |
| generateModelsFromSchema | boolean | If enabled, {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} will automatically interrogate the database and auto-generate Models from SQL tables. |
| modelAutogen | boolean | If enabled, {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} will automatically generate a full and rich CRUD API from the generated Models. |
| options | object | MSSQL Connection options |
| options.encrypt | boolean | Encrypt the database connection. Required when connecting to Azure. |

## Usage

After you configure the connector, you can start up your {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} project and visit the console (normally found under `http://localhost:8080/console`). Your connector will also be listed as a **Connector** when creating a [new model](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/api-builder/page/docs/developer_guide/models/create/index.html#create-a-new-model) in the console.

Your database tables will be listed under the [Models](http://localhost:8080/console/project/models) section of the console. You can now click on the gear icon to the right of the table names and generate flow based APIs.

You can also reference the connector in a custom model.

```javascript
const Account = APIBuilder.Model.extend('Account', {
  fields: {
    Name: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    }
  },
  connector: 'mssql'
});
```

If you want to map a specific model to a specific table, use metadata for `schema` and `table` name.  For example, to map the `account` model to the table named the table "\[dbo\].\[accounts\]":

```javascript
const Account = APIBuilder.Model.extend('account', {
  fields: {
    Name: {
      type: String,
      required: false,
      validator: /[a-zA-Z]{3,}/
    }
  },
  connector: 'mssql',
  metadata: {
    schema: 'dbo',
    table: 'accounts'
  }
});
```

If your table has a primary key, then you can use additional metadata:

```javascript
const Account = APIBuilder.Model.extend('account', {
  fields: {
    Name: {
      type: String,
      required: false,
      validator: /[a-zA-Z]{3,}/
    }
  },
  connector: 'mssql',
  metadata: {
    schema: 'dbo',
    table: 'accounts',
    primarykey: 'Name',
    primaryKeyDetails: {
      autogenerated: false,
      type: 'varchar'
    }
  }
});
```
