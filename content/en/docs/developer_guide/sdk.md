{{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} has a number of [preexisting flow-nodes](/docs/developer_guide/flows/flow_nodes/) for use, but you can also use the {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} SDK ([@axway/api-builder-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axway/api-builder-sdk)) to write your own flow-nodes.

Below are some resources that can help get you started writing your own flow-nodes:
