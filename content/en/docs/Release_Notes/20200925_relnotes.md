## Upgrade

Before updating, we recommend deleting package-lock.json if it exists.

To update an existing {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} application, execute the following command from within the application directory:

```bash
npm update
```

## Features

* #6547: Added togglable 'Basic' and 'Advanced' modes to Flow debugger that allows providing values for all Flow input parameters.

## Fixes

* #6558: Fixed regression with the @axway/api-builder-plugin-fn-json `Stringify` method where the `Value` parameter was incorrectly limited to be a string type. Now, this limitation has been removed and any type of data can be used as long as it can be JSON stringified.
