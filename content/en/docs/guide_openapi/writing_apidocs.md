## OpenAPI specification support

Currently, **OpenAPI** flow-trigger supports the following specifications:

* [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md)
* [OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md)

Note that OpenAPI 3.0 is the preferred standard for {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}}. All links in our documentation will be to this standard, unless there is a specific need to link to OpenAPI 2.0. If you are using OpenAPI 2.0, you should consider moving to 3.0, but if you choose to remain on 2.0, you may have to refer back to equivalent sections in 2.0.

Also note that [OpenAPI 3.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md) is currently not supported, but is on the roadmap.

## Unsupported features

The following features are currently unsupported by the **OpenAPI** flow-trigger. While you can document them in your OpenAPI specifications, their use may not work as expected during runtime. Unless otherwise indicated, assume that this is the case.

* OpenAPI 3 requestBody `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `allOf`, and `not` are only supported for `application/json`.  All other media types are not supported.
* OpenAPI 3 parameter [content](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#parameterObject) is currently not supported, and `schema` is required.
* OpenAPI 3 [link](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#link-object)ยน.
* OpenAPI 3 [callback](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#callbackObject)ยน.
* OpenAPI 3 parameter [media type encoding](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#encodingObject)ยน.
* OpenAPI 3 [discriminator](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#discriminatorObject).
* OpenAPI 2 [collectionFormat](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#fixed-fields-7) for `tsv` (tab separated value).
* OpenAPI 2 [collectionFormat](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#fixed-fields-7) array of items more than one level deep (i.e. does not support array of array items).
* OpenAPI 2 [collectionFormat](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#fixed-fields-7) `pipes` and `ssv` are not supported in `cookie`, `formData`, `header`, or `path` (only supported in `query`).
* `multipart/form-data` with arrays of binary data is not supported, e.g. `curl -F file[]=a -F file[]=b`.
* OpenAPI 3 [byte format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#data-types)ยน is supported, but it will not automatically decode the base64 data.
* OpenAPI 3 [base64 format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#considerations-for-file-uploads) is not supported because it is not really a valid [OpenAPI format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#data-types). The example is invalid and should be "byte".
* OpenAPI 3 cookie parameters for objects and arrays, `style="form", explode=true` [style](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#style-examples) is not supported.
* In _API Doc & Test_, APIs with `multipart/form-data` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies will fail to render examples and execute correctly if the body schema is missing an implicit `type: object`.

1. Using this feature in your OpenAPI specification will not cause any runtime issues, but using it may confuse clients.

## JSON schema versions

OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.1 both effectively support a subset of JSON schema draft-04 with additional restrictions and formats. Though, [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#data-types) supports [json-schema-draft-04](https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#draft-4), and [OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#dataTypes) supports the [Wright JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#draft-5), which is effectively draft-04 with some fixes (aka "json-schema-draft-05").

When writing JSON schema, understand that you are more/less targeting draft-04 syntax, and not any of the other [draft specifications](https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html).

## JSON schema format support

The following formats are available for JSON schema validation:

| JSON schema format | Reference | Validated |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------- |
| date | [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#dates-and-times) | yes |

## Editing OpenAPI documents

At this time, {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} does not have a UI for editing OpenAPI documents. We recommend using an external tool like [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io) to create and manage your OpenAPI documents (API First). It provides collaborateive design, mocking, and revision history. Before writing your own OpenAPI documents, you should be aware of the [unsupported features](#unsupported-features). Also, have a look at our [OpenAPI tips](/docs/guide_openapi/openapi_tips) for ideas on how to write better OpenAPI specifications.

### Use operationId

**OpenAPI** flow-trigger uses the [operationId](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#fixed-fields-8) to uniquely identify operations, which are necessary when binding specific API operations to flows. While the `operationId` is optional in OpenAPI, we would recommend using it. If one is not provided, **OpenAPI** flow-trigger will generate one dynamically from the operation HTTP method and path (including path parameters). This can have an adverse affect of unbinding previously bound flows, if these properties change.

Using `operationId` has the following benefits:

1. Allows you to change the HTTP method or path without any impact on previously bound flows.
1. Useful as a short-hand identifier.  For example, "getUserById" might be easier to communicate than "GET /organization/users/{userId}"
1. Used when writing flow files to disk, so it provides a stronger connection to the API specification. Should any issues arises with a flow, they can be more easily traced back to the OpenAPI operation.

Using OpenAPI `operationId` will make managing OpenAPI easier.

### Mutating OpenAPI documents

When **OpenAPI** flow-trigger loads your OpenAPI specification, it will tweak it to make it more correct for use as an {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} micro-service. The changes that **OpenAPI** flow-trigger makes to your specification, or the differences from your OpenAPI specification are detailed below.

#### Security changes

**OpenAPI** flow-trigger will remove all [security requirements](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#securityRequirementObject), and [security schemes](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#componentsSecuritySchemes) from the entire OpenAPI specification. This is because {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} has its own [configurable authentication](/docs/developer_guide/project/configuration/project_configuration#accesscontrol), and it will replace the security with its own.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="primary" %}}
You do not need to define your own OpenAPI security, {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} will do that for you.
{{% /alert %}}

#### API documentation overrides

**OpenAPI** flow-trigger will apply any configured [apidoc.overrides](/docs/developer_guide/project/configuration/project_configuration#apidoc). This allows one OpenAPI specification to be used in a variety of hosting situations. For example, the `servers` are probably different, depending on development, test, or production.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="primary" %}}
Plan on using the {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} [apidoc.overrides](/docs/developer_guide/project/configuration/project_configuration#apidoc) overrides for every hosting environment. You do not have to try to define all the environment(s) within one document.

## Default error codes and responses

API Builder provides can return default errors and responses to the client that are not handled by the flow. Such errors can occur when the client makes a bad request, fails authentication, exceeds upload limits, or if an unexpected error occurred. It is recommended that you include the detail of all the potential errors, so that client developers know what to expect from the API. For convenience, a full specification of all the errors are listed below for convenience to use within your OpenAPI specifications.

```yaml
