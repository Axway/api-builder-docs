## Summary

* [Upgrade](#upgrade)

* [Features](#features)

* [Fixes](#fixes)

* [Release Notes](#release-notes)

* [Updated Modules](#updated-modules)

* [Plugins](#updated-plugins)

* [Known Issues](#known-issues)

## Upgrade

Before updating, we recommend deleting package-lock.json if it exists.

To update an existing {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} Standalone application, execute the following command from within the application directory:

```bash
npm update
```

## Features

* [#6233:](#6233) Cannot see Error object messages in Flow engine/editor

* [#6249:](#6249) Support downloading OAS3 specification via CLI get-catalog

## Fixes

* [#6297:](#6297) Fix the plugin template to bump sdk version to "^0.2.0"

* [#6305:](#6305) Cannot copy parameter info/schema from Flow editor

* [#6315:](#6315) Make the console URL easier to click

## Release Notes

* #6233: Previously, `Error` objects output from flow-nodes during flow invocation would appear to be logged as empty "{}" objects at runtime. Now, the full error message is logged and `Error` that were output from flow-nodes can be encoded as JSON.

* #6249: Previously, the Amplify Builder CLI `get-catalog` commands only downloaded OAS 2 specifications from the Amplify Catalog. Now, the CLI will download OAS 2 and OAS 3 specifications.

* #6297: The CLI now generates plugins that depend on api-builder-sdk "^0.2.0".

* #6305: Previously, information from descriptions and schema in the Flow editor and definitions in API Doc and Test could not be copied. Now, they can be selected and copied.

* #6315: Previously, when starting an {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} service, the console URL was not clickable in some terminals due to the dot at the end of the URL. Now, the dot has been removed making the URL clickable in more terminals which support this functionality.

## Known Issues

* #3825: Filtering the {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} Console administrator access using IPv6 addresses may cause ENOTFOUND errors.

* #3867: When attempting to create and save a flow for an imported Swagger endpoint that contains a path or paths defined by references, the save will fail.

* #3979: Attempting to delete an endpoint in the UI that was created as a result of dereferencing a JSON `$ref` will yield a 404 error. {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} will fail to locate the method since it only exists when the whole Swagger document is dereferenced. An example of a Swagger document using `$ref`:

    ```
    {
     "swagger": "2.0",
     "paths" {
      "x-path": {
       "get": {}
      },
      "/find": {
       "$ref": "#/paths/x-path"
      },
      "/search": {
       "$ref": "#/paths/x-path"
      }

     }
    }
    ```

* #4528: Initializing a new project with `api-builder init 1234` where `1234` is any number will throw an ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE error rather than an "invalid npm package name" error.

* #4735: Invoking Upsert will fail for all data connectors when creating a composite model from an existing model and renaming one of the fields.

* #4749: A query on a `distinct` API created from the Mongo plugin (`@axway/api-builder-plugin-dc-mongo`) does not honor the value of the `order` parameter.

* #4750: The Upsert or FindAndModify methods are not present in the APIs generated from Mongo or MySQL connector based models.

* #4751: The FindAndModify method from APIs created using the Mongo plugin (`@axway/api-builder-plugin-dc-mongo`) responds with a 404 error rather than creating a new entry when the `upsert` parameter is `true`.

* #4752: The format of a distinct query response depends on the type of connector.

* #4759: Calling Update or FindAndModify on a model that uses the composite connector and contains the required fields may fail and cause the server to terminate.

* #4795: The MongoDB plugin `@axway/api-builder-plugin-dc-mongo` does not support primary keys that are not object identifiers correctly. The MongoDB specification allows for primary keys of other types. As a result, trying to use the plugin will result in errors:

    ```
    {
     "message": "Invalid Value for Find By ID: 'YOUR_STRING_PK_NAME'",
     "success": false,
     "request-id": "c118f187-2090-4a68-b939-37367ac55b80"
    }
    ```

* #4813: If the endpoint Swagger file in the `/endpoints` folder contains special characters in its name, for example `[test].json`, the endpoint is not rendered correctly in the UI.

* #4856: Passing in an invalid column name as a parameter to APIs generated from data connectors may result in an exception being thrown rather than the callback being executed with an error. A similar error may occur when using model flow-nodes, resulting in an error which cannot be handled by the flow.

* #4859: When endpoints are generated from a model, the endpoint descriptions do not use the correct plurals defined by the model.

* #4951: When endpoint or flow files with URL encoded characters in the filename are present in a project, unexpected errors may occur. For example, the wrong flow or endpoint could be modified. Using files with encoded characters in their names is not recommended.

* #4961: Having the `%` symbol in various file names can cause problems in the {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} Console and with direct linking. It is therefore advisable to avoid using `%` in API, Endpoint, Flow, Model, and Configuration file names. This is a result of an issue in react-router/history. For additional information, refer to [https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/issues/505](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/issues/505).

* #4966: {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} will generate invalid Swagger for programmatic APIs in `./apis` that bind to a path other than the `apiPrefix` defined in the configuration. These APIs must be bound to the same root path as defined by the `apiPrefix`.

* #5538: A model with a single-quote "'foo" is a valid model name, but not a valid endpoint name, so the single-quote will be stripped when generating endpoints. If another model "foo" exists and has generated endpoints, then generating endpoints for "'foo" with single-quote, will overwrite existing endpoints for "foo". The following characters are stripped from model names: `"?", ":", "'",` and `"."`.

* #6150: Stoplight always encodes default parameter values as strings, even though the type may not be a string (e.g. "number"). The Swagger validation will fail with an error, e.g. "Not a valid number". To work around the problem, you can manually change the parameter default from a string (e.g. `"42"`) to a number (e.g. `42`) by editing the Swagger directly, but that is not always an option. Alternatively, you can change the parameter type to a "string", and add a validation "pattern", e.g. `"[0-9]+"`.
