## Summary

* [Upgrade](#upgrade)

* [Features](#features)

* [Fixes](#fixes)

* [Updated Modules](#updated-modules)

* [Known Issues](#known-issues)

## Upgrade

Before updating, we recommend deleting package-lock.json if it exists.

To update an existing {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} application, execute the following command from within the application directory:

```bash
npm update
```

## Features

* #6788: Previously, all the Flows were listed under the URL /project/triggers in the UI. Now, it is moved to /project/flows.

* #6808: Added a new flow-node for logging messages from flows.

## Fixes

* #6802: Previously, the Kafka Producer in Kafka flow-trigger @axway/api-builder-plugin-ft-kafka was ignoring the configured advanced options when creating connections. Now, those are taken into account and Kafka Producer connections are configured correctly.

* #6803: Modified the startup order to ensure that the {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} Admin is loaded after flow-triggers. This makes the {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} Console URL more accessible after the server has started.

* #6805: Fixed a memory leak when the application reloads.

## Updated modules

* [@axway/api-builder-runtime@4.61.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axway/api-builder-runtime/v/4.61.1)
