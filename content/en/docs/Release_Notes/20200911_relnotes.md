```bash
npm update
```

## Features

* #6296: Added optional Advanced HTTP Options **Headers** parameter to Swagger plugin flow-nodes and custom OAS flow-nodes. This allows overriding headers, as well as defining any headers not in the OAS spec.

* #6485: Added Solace plugin to support publishing and subscribing to Solace topics.

* #6490: Added Kafka plugin to support publishing and subscribing to Kafka topics.

* #6549: Fixed regression with @axway/api-builder-plugin-fn-swagger where `basePath` could not be overridden in config for OAS2 documents.

* #6549: Add support to @axway/api-builder-plugin-fn-swagger for overriding an existing `basePath` with an empty string in config for OAS2 documents.

## Fixes

* #6519: Previously, when creating a new flow, clicking "Save and Exit" would not exit the Flow editor. Now, "Save and Exit" will work as expected.
