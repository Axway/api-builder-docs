# API Builder Docs

API Builder Docs is a docs-as-code implementation for Axway documentation. It is built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator with the [Google Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme. The site is deployed on Netlify at <https://api-builder-docs.netlify.app//>. Users can edit any documentation page using GitHub web UI or a WYSIWYG editor provided by [Netlify CMS](https://api-builder-docs.netlify.app/).

This repository contains all files for building and deploying the netlify site. The Markdown files for the documentation are stored at `/content/en/docs`. The image files for the documentation are stored at `/static/Images`.
