{{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} regularly adds feature improvements, fixes, and occasionally identify and fix features that do not work as designed, or are orthogonal to the intended direction of the product. When these are identified, we mark them as deprecated and add them to this document. We intend to remove all the deprecated features in the next major release of the product.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}To ensure that you stay abreast of important updates and to make it easier to upgrade, you should pay attention to the deprecation warnings and address them as soon as possible.{{% /alert %}}

Direct or indirect use of deprecated features may result in a warning when the service starts. This should not affect the functionality of your service, but the flags should be an indication that, if ignored, your service may fall behind any future breaking changes and may increase the effort to upgrade to future major releases.

## Deprecation flags

Where fixing a bug or introducing a feature would introduce a breaking change, we create a deprecation flag that is disabled by default, meaning that it will have no impact on your project. However, it should not be ignored. These flags are provided to allow you to manually review the change and be aware of a functional change that may also require code or config to be modified.

When addressing deprecation warnings with corresponding flags, you should compare the following set of flags with those located in your `./conf/default.js`. The full set of flags is below for convenience. In upgraded applications, the flags are disabled by default. However, newly created applications will have these flags enabled. For each deprecation warning, you should find the corresponding feature flag below, read the document, and understand how it applies to your application. To ensure that your application continues to operate as expected, it is essential that you have unit-tests for all your interfaces. Enabling a flag, without understanding or testing the impact can have adverse effects.

```javascript
// ./conf/default.js

module.exports = {
  flags: {
    // Flags to enable features that are not ready for production or
    // whose use may require manual upgrade steps in legacy services.
    // Enable support for aliases in comparison operators on composite models.
    // Breaking change for old versions as previously queries $lt, $gt, $lte, $gte, $in, $nin,
    // $eq would not have translated aliased fields.
    enableAliasesInCompositeOperators: false,
    // Enable support for the $like comparison operator in the Memory connector.
    enableMemoryConnectorLike: false,
    // Enable support for Models that have no primary key.
    // Breaking change for old versions as previously the Create API returned a location
    // header. Also the model advertised unsupported methods.
    enableModelsWithNoPrimaryKey: false,
    // Generate APIs and Flows that user primary key type rather than always assuming string.
    // Breaking change for old versions as the generated APIs will change when enabled.
    usePrimaryKeyType: false,
    // Enabling this flag will cause the service to exit when there is a problem loading a plugin
    exitOnPluginFailure: false,
    // Enabling this flag ensures that a plugin only receives the config relevant to that plugin.
    enableScopedConfig: false,
    // Enable support for null fields coming from Models
    enableNullModelFields: false,
    // Enable support for model names being percent-encoded as per RFC-3986 in auto-generated
    // API. Breaking change for old versions as previously names like "foo/bar" will now be
    // encoded as "foo%2Fbar"
    enableModelNameEncoding: false,
    // Enable support for model names being percent-encoded as per RFC-3986 in {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}}'s
    // Swagger. Breaking change for old versions as previously names like "foo/bar" will now
    // be encoded as "foo%2Fbar"
    enableModelNameEncodingInSwagger: false,
    // Enable support for model names being encoded whilst preserving the connector's slash.
    // This flag only applies when enableModelNameEncodingInSwagger is enabled.
    // Breaking change for old versions as previously model names that start with a connector
    // name, e.g. "oracle/fo√≥" will now be encoded as "oracle/fo%C3%B3".
    enableModelNameEncodingWithConnectorSlash: false,
    // Enable support for overriding endpoint content-type using the flow's
    // HTTP response headers.
    enableOverrideEndpointContentType: false,
    // Enable support for model flow-nodes having Error outputs.
    enableModelErrorOutputs: false,
    // Enabling this flag will cause the service to exit when there is an error
    // validating the service Swagger or any loaded JSON schema.
    exitOnSwaggerSchemaValidationError: false,
    // Enabling this flag will emit the log level in each log message.
    enableLoggingOfLevel: true,
    // Enabling this flag will ignore HTTP payload body on methods GET,
    // and HEAD.
    enableStrictBodyPayloads: true
  }
};
```
