This topic provides examples of using the flow editor on the API Orchestration user interface to create flows and configure and connect the flow-nodes in the flow. The examples use the Swagger definition import of the test user service endpoints. For additional information on importing endpoints, refer to the Importing endpoints section of [Manage Endpoints](/docs/developer_guide/flows/manage_endpoints/). The following flow examples are provided:

* [Count Users](/docs/developer_guide/flows/manage_flows/flow_examples/count_users/)
