## Features

* 4748: Allow swagger scheme, host, and basePath to be editable via configuration

## Fixes

* 4896: Swagger for autogenerated APIs belonging to connectors fails to download

## Release notes

* #4748: A new `apidoc` section has been added in the configuration allowing for the host, schemes, and basePath of the swagger API documentation to be overridden so that {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} can continue to provide valid documentation when the service is behind a proxy or ingress. This new section also gives control over where the documentation is hosted (`apidoc.prefix`) and if the documentation is turned off (`apidoc.disabled`). These new values override `admin.apiDocPrefix` and `admin.disableAPIDoc` and are provided instead of them for new projects. For more information on how to configure this, see the [project configuration documentation](/docs/developer_guide/project/configuration/project_configuration/). See deprecations {{% deprecation/link D002 %}} and {{% deprecation/link D003 %}}.
* #4748: Previously, the configuration option `admin.disableAPIDoc` kept the swagger API documentation disabled, even in development mode - which was opposed by the config documentation. Now, since the documentation is required for the admin console to function correctly if the admin console is enabled and installed, the value of `admin.disableAPIDoc` will not be acknowledged. This will not affect production installs.
* #4748: Previously, if the service had no apiPrefix configured, the swagger API documentation would include an invalid (empty) basePath. Now, basePath will not be added to the swagger API documentation if the service configuration results in an empty basePath.
* #4896: Previously, the Download Swagger button on the API details page may not work if the API name contains characters that require URL encoding. Now, the Download Swagger works for all APIs.
