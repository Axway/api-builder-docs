## Summary

This release includes:

* [Upgrade](#upgrade)

* [Features](#features)

* [Fixes](#fixes)

* [Known Issues](#known-issues)

## Upgrade

Before updating, we recommend deleting package-lock.json if it exists.

To update an existing {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} application, execute the following command from within the application directory:

```bash
npm update
```

## Features

* #6775: References to the Amplify CLI in the {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} CLI and documentation have been replaced with with the Axway CLI.

## Fixes

* #6774: Previously, when deleting all flow-triggers from the flow and saving the flow, the last flow-trigger would never be deleted. Now, flow-triggers are deleted as expected.

* #6780: Previously, when restarting {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}}, the Kafka flow-trigger [@axway/api-builder-plugin-ft-kafka](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axway/api-builder-plugin-ft-kafka) would occasionally cause an error, `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: Cannot read property 'warn' of undefined`. Now, Kafka can be restarted without error.

* #6791: Previously, it was possible to create invalid models via the API that had invalid field types and subsequently cause the server to crash with the error: `Swagger schema validation failed`. Now, model field types are restricted to: array, boolean, date, number, object, and string.
