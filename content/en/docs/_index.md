## Overview

From {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} V4.0.0 onward, you can now create your independent services for containerization and deployment on your container platform of choice.

In this first version, you will be able to install the {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} CLI, create a new project, and run it from the command line, all without the need to create a user account or host your project on the Axway platform.

{{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} lets you build and deploy a project that is comprised of API endpoints that can be consumed by any client application. An {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} project is a Node.js application that runs as a service and is comprised of several components. You can either define the components using JavaScript or JSON files placed in specific directories, which are automatically loaded when creating an {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} instance or programmatically create components after initializing an {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} instance. For information about the components, see the sections below.

To get started, see the [Getting Started With {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}}](/docs/getting_started_with_api_builder/).
