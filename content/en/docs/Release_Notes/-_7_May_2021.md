## Upgrade

Before updating, we recommend deleting package-lock.json if it exists.

To update an existing {{% variables/apibuilder_prod_name %}} application, execute the following command from within the application directory:

```bash
npm update
```

## Features

* #6697: Trigger template used to render triggers in Flow UI now contains initial values for the enum properties which results in rendering those properties with preselected values. The initial value is calculated from the schema "default" property with fallback to the first item of schema "examples" property or to the first item of the enum.

* #6856: Previously, while running in production and under conditions where startup takes a long time, it was possible for the Kafka flow-trigger to start and then for the connection to become unstable (e.g. if the Kafka server went down) before the server finished starting, and if that happened, Kafka would emit unstable causing the server to be in an inconsistent state (unstable and not started), and error with `TypeError: Cannot read property 'error' of undefined`. Now, the server handles this unstable condition on startup and exits cleanly in production.

## Fixes

* #6833: Flow-node log messages are now consistently prefixed with the flow-node's display name. For users writing custom flow-nodes, this change applies to all logs made by the flow-node action logger. Additionally, when a flow-node invokes, the name of the method being invoked is now also logged.

* #6865: Fixed issue with fork [@livereach/jsonpath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livereach/jsonpath) that made it vulnerable to [CVE-2021-23358](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23358). Replaced forked module with original [jsonpath.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath)
